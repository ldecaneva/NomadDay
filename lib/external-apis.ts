/**
 * External APIs for Flight and Hotel Data
 *
 * This file documents the APIs that would be needed for real flight and hotel data integration.
 */

/**
 * For Hotel Data and Images:
 *
 * Google Places API
 * Documentation: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview
 *
 * This API provides:
 * - Hotel information (name, address, contact details)
 * - Photos and images
 * - Star ratings and user reviews
 * - Amenities and features
 *
 * To implement:
 * 1. Get an API key from Google Cloud Console
 * 2. Enable the Places API
 * 3. Use the Places API to search for hotels in the destination
 * 4. Use the Place Details API to get detailed information about each hotel
 * 5. Use the Place Photos API to get images of the hotels
 */

/**
 * For Flight Data:
 *
 * Google doesn't currently offer a public flight search API (QPX Express was discontinued).
 * Alternative flight search APIs include:
 *
 * 1. Skyscanner API
 *    Documentation: https://developers.skyscanner.net/docs/getting-started
 *
 * 2. Amadeus Flight Offers Search API
 *    Documentation: https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-offers-search
 *
 * 3. Kiwi.com API
 *    Documentation: https://docs.kiwi.com/
 *
 * These APIs provide:
 * - Flight search functionality
 * - Pricing information
 * - Availability
 * - Airline details
 * - Flight schedules
 *
 * To implement:
 * 1. Sign up for an API key with one of these providers
 * 2. Use their API to search for flights based on departure location, destination, dates, etc.
 * 3. Parse the response to display flight options to the user
 */

/**
 * Implementation Notes:
 *
 * 1. API keys should be stored securely as environment variables on the server
 * 2. API calls should be made from the server-side to protect API keys
 * 3. Consider implementing caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
 * 4. Be aware of rate limits and pricing for each API
 * 5. Implement error handling for API failures
